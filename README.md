# Fire-Detection-In-Indoor-and-Outdoor-Environment
🔥 Fire Detection in Indoor & Outdoor Environments
📌 Overview

This project presents a real-time fire detection system built using the YOLOv8 deep learning model, designed to work effectively in both indoor and outdoor environments. Fire hazards pose a serious threat to human lives, property, and the environment, making early detection a critical requirement. By leveraging the power of computer vision and object detection, this project aims to provide a fast, reliable, and accurate fire detection solution that can be deployed across diverse scenarios such as homes 🏠, industries 🏭, offices, and forest surveillance 🌲.

⚙️ System Functionality

The system works by training YOLOv8 on a custom dataset consisting of fire images from varied environments. Once trained, the model is capable of detecting fire in images, videos, and live camera feeds in real time. Each detected fire instance is highlighted with bounding boxes along with confidence scores, ensuring accuracy and minimizing false positives.

✅ Real-time detection from CCTV or webcams

✅ Works in both indoor & outdoor settings

✅ High precision and recall on test data

✅ Scalable for multiple use cases

🛠️ Technology Stack

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Framework: PyTorch

Model: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

🚀 Applications

🔔 Early fire warning systems in smart homes

🏭 Industrial monitoring to prevent workplace hazards

🌲 Forest fire surveillance for environmental protection
